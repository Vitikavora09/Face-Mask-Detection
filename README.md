# Face mask detection

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. It's built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on an image dataset of masked and unmasked faces.


## Features

- Image data preprocessing and augmentation

- CNN model building from scratch

- Model training with validation

- Performance evaluation using accuracy and loss plots




## Objectives

- Design and implement a CNN model for face mask detection.
- Train the model on a dataset of images containing people with and without masks.
- Evaluate the model's performance on test data.
- Integrate the model into a real-time face mask detection system.



## Libraries Used

- TensorFlow/Keras

- OpenCV

- NumPy

- Matplotlib
